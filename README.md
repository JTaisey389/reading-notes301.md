### About Me
Hi everyone! My name is Jason and I was a *Project Manager* for two years in the custom signage industry. Coming from a project management background has provided me with a unique perspective on software development. What pushed me to leave project management was the realization that it just wasn’t the right career choice for me. I enjoyed being involved directly with a project, but project management left me out of making the final decisions. After talking to my partner we decided that it was best to leave my job and I would pursue going back to school full time and thus lead me to Code Fellows. What I see in software development is the ability to not only directly create a user interface, but heavily relies on a problem-solving mindset. I like to think of that problem solving just like a puzzle, and every time you add another piece it’s very rewarding. My **creative mindset** is fueled by software development, and having a cohort of individuals embrace that creative mindset reaffirms my belief that I’ve made the right career move.
