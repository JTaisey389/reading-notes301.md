## Read 15 Diversity and Inclusion

- A lot of programmers back in the day who paved the path for computer programing were women and for decades, the number of women studying computer science was growing faster than the number of men. For some reason in 1984 that changes and the percentage of women in computer science flattened and eventually plunged. 

- One of the key points to why the share of women in computer science took a dive is roughly when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers. For the most part though these early computers were mostly marketed towards men and body because computers were like toys. 

- Over time this became a narrative and became the story we told ourselves about the computing revolution. This began to shape who the geeks were, and created a techie culture. 

- In the 1990's researcher Jane Margolis interviewed students at Carnegie Mellon Univveristy and she found that families were more likely to buy computers for boys than girls. This became a big deal when those children went to college. 

- In summary women in technology transitioned greatly because of a lot of unforeseen factors and back in that time there was an implicit bias the men would be the primary people to target for computer science. 

### Why Diversity Matters
- A push from a majority of tech companies is to increase the diversity within it's organizations. Diversity efforts are most successful when they are driven by a commitment from company leaders. This commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters. Here are five important themes that have presented themselves with the conversation surrounding diversity.

1. Diverse teams are smarter and more creative
  - Study after study finds that fields like science, psychology and education indicate that diversity offers significant benefits for teams focused on creativity and innovation. 

2. Diverse Companies Perform better
  - Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogenous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and increased financial outcomes. 

3. Companies are loosing out on great talent
  - Failing to attract and hire employees from unrepresented background leads to companies to miss out on awesome talent. By attracting diverse candidates and designing interviewing processes that ensure a level playing field, companies have a better chance of ensuring the best idea is on the table. 

4. Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base.
  - When the employee of an organization better represents their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups. 

5. It is the right thing to do
  - While diversity and inclusion efforts are most often driven by business rationales. Leaders have notes that the tech industry is creating vast opportunity and that by excluding certain groups from that opportunity this increases social inequality.
