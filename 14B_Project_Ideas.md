## Read 14B Project Idea's

- What ideas do you have for projects? What would your model be that you can control and update the view with? What API(s) could you use to make this a reality?

### Idea 1 - Travel Website tells the user data about the destination
- This is a pivot of an original idea I came up with from 201 that is a travel website that assists with helping the user to decide on a vacation destination. As an example of that there is a transportation api for **London England** , in this example you could search for transportation options while in London. 

- To build upon the usability you could also add an a **weather api** to see what the weather forecast will be while visiting this destination. As you build this trip out you start to research site seeing spots or even local restaurants with reviews. Just like we did in our city explorer app we can search Yelp for reviews and receive results back. 

- While in London you could look up events through **Ticketmaster** api and it just so happens that **The Who** are playing at a local stadium nearby and you want to purchase tickets. This would allow the user to create a great vacation itinerary by way of API's. 

### Idea 2 - A mental heath website for facts and information
- This idea is a little more interpersonal because as we all know the pandemic has had an effect on everyone of us in each way, through this website you can research mental health professionals to provide you with guidance. As part of the self worth you decide you want to research into nutrition so we could use the **Nutritionix API**. For some this is the motivation needed to focus on mental health. 

- As part of the focus for betterment you have decided to move from your current city and this is where the **teleport API** comes in handy. This will provide me with a fantastic widget that shows the quality of life based on the location of choosing. You can look into the job market, what the average salary is, and even what the culture is like. You can become educated in the best location you want to move to and make the leap to start your life fresh. 

- It's official you decide to move to Switzerland! The question now looms of how you are going to get around the country because you don't want a car and trains have always fascinated you. Well the great news is you can tap into the **Swiss Railways Network** to see where the trains go and what line you should take. It's super useful because you quickly realize you have met a wonderful group of friends through a support group and one of them happens to live in Switzerland! With the app it makes it easier to go and visit them all the while taking the Swiss Railways.
